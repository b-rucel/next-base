title: Image and Link
description: This section provides an overview of how NextBase handles links and images in Markdown.
---

In NextBase, all links and images written in Markdown are automatically converted to their respective Next.js 15 components. This enables optimal performance through automatic image optimization and enhanced client-side navigation.

## Links

When you create a link in your Markdown, it is converted to the Next.js `Link` component, enabling instant client-side navigation and improved loading times. Here's an example:

### Markdown example

```
[Visit NextBase Documentation](https://docs.nextbase.dev)
```

### Rendered Output

The above Markdown is converted to:

```
<Link 
    href="/docs/getting-started/introduction" 
    className="text-primary hover:text-primary/80 transition-colors"
>
    Getting Started with NextBase
</Link>
```

## Images

Markdown images are automatically transformed into the Next.js `Image` component, providing built-in optimization features like lazy loading, responsive sizing, and automatic WebP conversion. Here's how it works:

### Markdown example

```
![NextBase Logo](/images/logo.png)
```

### Rendered Output

The above Markdown is converted to:

```
<Image
    src="/images/logo.png"
    alt="NextBase Logo"
    width={800}
    height={400}
    className="rounded-lg"
    priority={false}
/>
```

## Benefits

- **Automatic Optimization**: Images are automatically optimized for different device sizes and formats
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded only when they enter the viewport
- **Responsive Sizing**: Automatically serves the right size image for the user's device
- **WebP Support**: Converts images to WebP format when supported by the browser
- **Blur Placeholder**: Optional blur-up placeholder while images load

## Best Practices

- Always provide meaningful `alt` text for accessibility
- Use appropriate image dimensions to avoid layout shifts
- Consider setting `priority={true}` for above-the-fold images
- Optimize source images before adding them to your project
